# Histopathologic-Cancer-Detection-

1. Developed the classification models for cancer prognosis to efficiently utilize the information underlying the histopathological images
2. Used the PatchCamelyon benchmark datasets to train in the different models, multilayer perceptron, convolution, ResNet50, InceptionV3
and ensemble to observe the modelâ€™s performance in terms of precision, recall, f1 score, accuracy, and AUC score
