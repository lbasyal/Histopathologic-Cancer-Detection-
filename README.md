# Histopathologic Cancer Detection

1. Developed cancer prognosis classification models to leverage histopathological image data effectively.
2. Trained models using the PatchCamelyon benchmark datasets, including multilayer perceptron, convolutional networks, ResNet50, InceptionV3, and ensemble techniques. Evaluated model performance in terms of precision, recall, F1 score, accuracy, and AUC score.
